# game-engine

It's been a very long time since I touched C++. Probably six years or so. This project is intended to re-visit the world
of C++ with many of the concepts that I've learned in my career as a software engineer.

C++ was one of the very first programming languages I used at university. I loved how hands on it can be compared to
Java/JS. One thing I did a long time ago was create a game engine with OpenGL and Java. I intend to do the same thing
again but with C++ as the GL host.

I'm using CMake with this project.
